# Lane Detection

In this approach, the goal is to detect lane lines on the road using computer vision techniques without relying on deep learning algorithms. The core components used in this approach are OpenCV, Canny edge detection, and the Hough transform line detection algorithm. The overall process involves the following steps:

Step 1: Color Selection
Initially, the image is processed to select specific colors that represent the lane lines. This step helps in isolating the lane lines from the rest of the image.


Step 2: Canny Edge Detection
The Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to the color-selected image to detect edges, which helps in identifying the boundaries of objects, including lane lines.


Step 3: Region of Interest Selection
A region of interest (ROI) is defined to focus only on the area of the image where lane lines are expected to appear. This step helps in reducing computation and improving the accuracy of lane detection.


Step 4: Hough Transform Line Detection
The Hough transform algorithm is applied to detect straight lines in the edge-detected image within the defined region of interest. This helps in identifying the candidate lines that could represent the lane lines on the road.
By following these steps, lane lines can be detected accurately without the need for complex deep learning models. This approach provides a simple yet effective solution for lane detection in various scenarios, such as autonomous driving systems or lane departure warning systems in vehicles.
